# dynamic-backlighting
Grabs average color of display and changes the color and illumination of LED's hooked to a Rasperry Pi accordingly.
This is a faster and more configurable version written completely in C# compared to the much less powerfull .pde file available online.
It is not based on the .pde version instead being a rewrite as I was not satisfied with the other version.
(Currently only release is available)
